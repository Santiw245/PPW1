                <h1>About USSS</h1>
                <p>
                    UraShimaSakataSen (浦島坂田船), or USSS for short, is a 4-unit indie 
                    pop boy group consisting of Uratanuki (Green), Shima (Purple), Sakata 
                    (Red) and Senra (Yellow). They teamed up in 2013 and opened at least 
                    one live tour each year. They also have their own commercial items such 
                    as the Gachapon or some merchandise on the DEEN shop website. They have a
                    close relationship in real life.
                    <br><br>
                    In Spring 2017, USSS formed a fictional unit called "Fourpe" (フォープ Fōpu)
                    under contract with NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan. In Fall 2019, the group
                    received a short deformed animated comedy series, Days of Urashimasakatasen
                    (浦島坂田船の日常 Urashimasakatasen no Nichijō).
                    <br><br>
                    USSS official illustrations were often drawn by the illustrator Tsukimori Fuyuka
                    (月森フユカ) up until 2019 and MACCO from then onwards, while most of their original
                    songs are composed by the producer Sum. 
                </p>
                <h1 id="urata">Urata</h1>
                <p>
                    Uratanuki (うらたぬき) is an utaite with a smooth, cute and nasal voice that
                    could be defined as somewhat shota. He often changes his voice quality to fit 
                    to the song's atmosphere, but it's noted that he is still able to keep his high
                    and pleasant tone. 
                    <br><br>
                    Urata was also known to frequently imitate the voice of Suzumura Kenichi, most 
                    frequently as the character Okita Sougo from the anime Gintama. Later on in his
                    career he was able to do official voice work for various projects, as well as for
                    his work in USSS. 
                </p>
                <h1 id="shima">Shima</h1>
                <p>
                    Shima (志麻) is an utaite who began covering in 2010. He has a sexy and confident 
                    voice, but did not use it frequently during his initial period as an utaite; in the
                    beginning, he primarily sung parody songs, most of them Gintama versions. He often
                    uses high tones and changes to random types of voices within a parody cover. This 
                    style leads people to think that he does not sing seriously though it is also the
                    reason for his popularity.
                    <br><br>
                    However, after Shima got his renown, he stopped singing parody songs. He now sings in
                    lower tones than before with a substantial amount of vibrato, though he possesses a
                    wide vocal range, as seen in his cover of "Ai no Scenario"
                </p>
                <h1 id="sakata">Sakata</h1>
                <p>
                    Aho no Sakata (あほの坂田) is an utaite, who used to be notable for imitating voice 
                    actor Sugita Tomokazu in roles such as Sakata Gintoki (Gintama), Hoshi (Arakawa Under
                    the Bridge), and Kyon (Suzumiya Haruhi no Yuuutsu). However, he is far better known
                    for his more "normal" covers and his status as a member of USSS. His most popular 
                    normal cover is "Christmas Song", which has gained 1.15 million views as of February
                    2017.
                    <br><br>
                    His most popular cover is his Hoshi version of "Fukkireta", which gained 706K views
                    as of March 2013. 
                </p>
                <h1 id="senra">Senra</h1>
                <p>
                    Senra (センラ) is an utaite whose voice is noted to sound a little like Hiroshi
                    Kamiya's.
                    <br><br>
                    During the peak of interest in Durarara!! in the late 2000s, Senra was well known
                    for a voice imitation version of "Ren'ai Circulation", "Izaya Circulation", in which
                    he imitated the Kamiya-voiced Izaya, and which was also his first cover to get into
                    the Utattemita ranking charts. At that time, his videos earned tags such as "a 
                    wild Izaya" (野生の臨也, Yasei no Izaya), "not annoying Izaya" (うざくない臨也, 
                    uzakunai Izaya) or "Kanra ver." (甘楽ver). However, it has been noted that he 
                    could also imitate the voice of Hitachiin Kaoru from Ouran High School Host Club,
                    voiced by Fujita Yoshinori.
                    <br><br>
                    Nevertheless, Senra also sings normally, without voice imitations, very often.
                    His voice has a subtle nasal but unique tone to it. The imitations have long 
                    since stopped, although he does do minor voice acting for the various USSS album
                    trailers.
